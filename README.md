Employee Tracker is a mySQL database with a command line prompt-based interface. It allows managers to view departments, roles, and employees in their company so that they can plan and organize their business.

  THEN I am presented with the job title, role id, the department that role belongs to, and the salary for that role
- WHEN I choose to view all employees
  THEN I am presented with a formatted table showing employee data, including employee ids, first names, last names, job titles, departments, salaries, and managers that the employees report to
- WHEN I choose to add a department
  THEN I am prompted to enter the name of the department and that department is added to the database

  THEN I am prompted to enter the name, salary, and department for the role and that role is added to the database
- WHEN I choose to add an employee
